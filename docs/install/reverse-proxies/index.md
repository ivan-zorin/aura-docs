# Reverse Proxies

:::warning

Aura and its components does not support being server on a sub-path. (e.g. `location /remnawave {`)

It has to be served on the root path of a domain or subdomain.

:::

:::note

**SSH Port Forwarding** is not supported. Use only with one of the reverse proxies below.

:::

:::tip

You need to have a registered domain name to continue.

If you don't have one, you can use [TryCloudflare](/docs/install/reverse-proxies/try-cloudflare) for development purposes.

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList/>
```
